The following repository details the implementation of
a deep learning agent using reinforcement learning, specifically
it details the use of deep Q-networks to achieve state of the art
results in the context of Pong, the classic Atari 2600 console
game. The given solution includes advanced optimization tools
such as the epsilon-greedy algorithm, a replay buffer and a
target network to further increase the accuracy of the agent.
Results show that our model manages to outperform the hardcoded
Pong agent, winning with 21 - 0, the maximum score.
